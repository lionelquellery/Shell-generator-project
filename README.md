## Motivation

Developers lose a lot of time starting a new project so you have to automate certain tasks


## In tech 

Gulp , sass , browser-sync , shell

## Difference between ini.sh & ini-starter.sh

#### ini.sh
The ini.sh will simply create from scratch a new front-starter. See the file for further details.

#### ini-starter.sh
The ini-starter.sh is based on this [front-starter](https://github.com/lmarti17/front-end-starter).
Basically, shell will clone this repo and build the project. So you need network.
**REQUIRE:** A 'Sites/' directory in your User directory !
